'Cidget' (CI/CD Widget) is a desktop widget tool that integrates source code hosting services (such as GitHub) and CI/CD pipelines (such as Azure Devops).

The tool will display pending pull requests, ongoing CI builds and deployments in realtime, and users can navigate to corresponding repository/pipeline from the widget.

It also popups notifications for other activities in code repositories. For instance, when pull request is merged to a branch, or when a pull request is closed.
